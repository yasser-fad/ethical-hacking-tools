# ethical-hacking-tools
Learning ethical hacking and python by coding basic tools with python
=> I've see that the best way to learn python is starting from basics, by coding  basics tools from scratch for ethical hacking so i will  understand the ethical
tools very well and start learning python.

=> I am learning to secure my computers, and my web services and understang the attackes.

=> Using the built-in tools in different OSs without knowing what is going in the background, will not be good for future purposes like creating my own tool later.

=> Learning to code these tools will develop my logic, information in networks, and coding network tools.

=> I am in the learning process so this repo is not completed or efficient in great way.

=> These tools works fine on kali linux.

=> These tools are created for only learning purposes, using it in harmful way, will be on your responsibility.

# THE DEFENTIONS OF THESE TOOLS 
1- MAC: IS a MAC spoofing tool for changing the Media Access Control (MAC) address of a network interface on a networked device.
2- nscan tool: It is a network scanning tool which is used for hacking information gathering method, if you are connected to a network and the target device
In the same network, a network scan must be done to discover all the devices' IP and mac addresses.
3-ARP_spoofer:To redirect the flow of packets to the hacker, it will allow the hacker to read, modify and delete the reason for this attack is that ARP
Unsafe
how it work :Send 2 ARP response to the gateway and the other to the target machine, the hacker sends to the victim that he is the gateway and for the gateway.
He's the victim by changing mac addresses, so the hacker becomes a man in the middle.
after we having the packet flow to our pc using arp spoofer we should start reading the packets.
Packetsniffer:
Capture of data flowing through an interface, allowing data to be sniffed and read.
